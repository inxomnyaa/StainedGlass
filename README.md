# StainedGlass
Adds StainedGlass to PMMP. Looks like normal Glass, but works with this MCPE addon: http://mcpedl.com/stained-glass-unlocker-addon/

# MCPE 1.2+ news!
This plugin turns out to work perfectly on 1.2 beta! Due to proper implementation of stained glass you wouldn't even need the addon anymore!
